Full stack software engineer with a passion for creation. My favorite thing about my work/study is the freedom to build things from the ground up. 
I have a strong foundation in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and React and I plan to grow that list continuously over the course of my career. 
I love meeting new people, and working/learning with other developers. I believe success in life stems from a strong desire to learn throughout life, be kind to others, and strive to be 1% better every day.
